# 📅 Daily Ticket Workflow Guide

## Overview

TicketTrack Pro now supports **daily-based ticket tracking**, allowing the same ticket ID to be processed on multiple days as separate entries. This is perfect for workflows where tickets are assigned daily and need independent tracking for each day.

## 🎯 Key Features

### **Daily Independence**
- Same ticket ID can be added on different dates
- Each day's entry is tracked separately
- Daily statistics are calculated independently
- Historical data is preserved by date

### **Flexible View Modes**
- **Today View**: Focus on current work date
- **Date Range View**: Analyze specific time periods  
- **All Time View**: See complete historical data

### **Smart Duplicate Handling**
- Prevents duplicate ticket IDs on the same work date
- Updates existing entries when adding the same ticket ID on the same date
- Allows same ticket ID across different dates

## 🚀 How It Works

### **Adding Tickets**

1. **Select Work Date**: Choose the date this ticket work was performed
2. **Enter Ticket ID**: Same ID can be used across different dates
3. **Set Status**: Awaiting Response or Resolved
4. **Add Notes**: Optional details for this specific date

### **Example Workflow**

```
Day 1 (Jan 15):
- Add ticket "7738691833" - Status: "Awaiting Response"

Day 2 (Jan 16): 
- Add ticket "7738691833" again - Status: "Resolved"
- This creates a NEW entry for Jan 16, separate from Jan 15

Result: Two separate entries for the same ticket ID on different dates
```
